#The SOA Research Platform (SOAR)

1. SOA Complete: Prove benefits and capabilities from a minimal basis.
2. Extensions: Increase ease of use and efficiency by coordination, etc.
3. Management: Improve SOA life cycle by change control, etc.
4. Execution: Improve execution environment by working on QoS, QoE, reliability, dependability, scalability, etc.

The point here is *not* to make a platform to build production-level SOAs, but to create a platform which can be leveraged to try new ideas.

## Building
    export GOPATH=/path/to/checkout
    goinstall -clean frontend assets render

This will build all executables and install to /path/to/checkout/bin
